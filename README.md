# pancake-sort
A little python program visualizing the pancake sort algorithm

I can't speak for you, but I love sorting algorithms and baking pancakes, so when I found out there was such a thing as pancake sort, I had no choice but to play around with it.

While doing this, I also get a little bit more insights about how the tkinter library works.

## TODO's
### QOL
* resize pancake stack when the window changes size
* add a start/pauze button
* select option for pancake sizes range and amount


### Functions
* sort 'burned' pancakes (pancakes have one burned side which always has to be on the bottom)
